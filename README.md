Study Guide for Bootcamp Prework
# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help students understand the material that they learned while completing the prework. This webpage puts the vital information in one place so that students can study without having to go back to each module. I learned that HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript all work hand in hand to create websites and they are all essential.

## Usage

There are four sections in the Prework Study Guide: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Each section contains notes that can be used to study each topic. A student can open the DevTools console by right clicking anywhere on the page and clicking on inspect, then clicking on console. This shows JavaScript running and there is a list of all the topics learned in the prework. There is also a suggestion of which topic to study first.
